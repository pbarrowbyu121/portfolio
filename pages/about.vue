        <p class="pt-6">
          I recently decided to pursue a career in web development, pivoting
          from my prior career in actuarial analysis. The problem solving and
          model building aspect of actuarial work enticed me to make the switch.
          Iâ€™ve been teaching myself through various online resources, primarily
          FreeCodeCamp.org and Frontend Masters.
