        <p class="pt-6">
          I am a self-taught frontend web developer who transitioned from a
          career in actuarial science in 2020 to pursue my passion for coding. I
          acquired my skills through platforms like FreeCodeCamp.org, Frontend
          Masters, and YouTube, driven by my enjoyment of problem-solving and
          the creative challenges of web development. I have applied my
          knowledge by creating a personal website that simulates stock trading,
          demonstrating my ability to innovate and apply technical skills in
          practical projects.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          In my spare time I enjoy playing pickleball, hiking, mountain biking,
          reading, recreational writing, Dungeons and Dragons, and building
          tabletop rpg scenery.
